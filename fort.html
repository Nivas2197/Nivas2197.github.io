            <h2>Murud-Janjira Fort</h2>
            <p>The origins of Janjira Fort can be traced back to the 14th century when it served as a stronghold for the Siddi dynasty, a powerful naval force of African descent. Over the centuries, the fort witnessed numerous sieges and battles, yet it never fell under the control of any invading power. This remarkable feat is attributed to the fort‚Äôs strategic location, intricate defenses, and the valiant resistance of its defenders.</p>
