            <h2>Panchgani</h2>
            <p>Panchgani is the twin Maharashtra Hill Stations of Mahabaleshwar which is just 20kms from there; it goes without saying that if you visit one, visiting the other is a must! The town has an archaic look and feels owing to the heritage buildings and bungalows around it.
The name comes from the word ‚ÄúPanch‚Äù because of the five hills that clasp this hill station. If you are out there to exhilarate with adventure things to do then you should visit the Tapola Lake where you can latch on to the same. Make it an edifying trip, and ascend to Table Top Land, the mystified plateau where nothing ever grows!
